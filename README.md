# Template Project for HaxeFlixel games

### Template features:
- FMOD Studio project with menu sound effects and a random song I wrote
- Main menu with buttons to load the credits or start the game
- Credits state with built-in scrolling
- Preconfigured .gitignore

## Running
- Run the `init.sh` the first time you start using the project
- If using VSCode, from the build targets, select the `HTML5 Debug Dev Analytics`
- If building the game from command line, built it with the `-D dev_analytics` flag
	- The game will not run if you don't provide that flag
