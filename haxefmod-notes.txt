Notes:

- Fix each thing and make it look right in the GMTK2020 game

- For the constants file to be formatted correctly, FMOD Studio event names must be a single word (no spaces) OR the static variable name needs to have underscores put in using a javascript regex
- Selected location for fmod studio script needs to be the source folder, not the root of the project
- There are docs for the c++ side, but not for the js side
- Check if a given reference is currently playing
- Assign a reference to a given sound (and return error if the reference name is taken)
- Error strings don't give any context around what call failed
- The FMOD Studio project sometimes has artifact events that show up in the constant file generation
- Ability to either play a sound with a set volume or to set the volume via a function
- Need to be able to check if a sound is playing
- Add ability to pause and resume a sound
